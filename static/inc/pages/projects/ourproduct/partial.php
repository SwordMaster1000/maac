            <h2>Wheels</h2>
            <p>The wheels, with their 9" diameter, create a ratio between them and the motor that increases torque and reduces wear-and-tear. Friction tape wrapped around the perimeter of the wheels provides improved traction.</p>

            <h2>Casters</h2>
            <p>
                Specially designed casters with sphere shaped wheels allow for reduced friction while maintaining balance. This becomes particularly important when carrying heavy loads of corn and/or seeds that would otherwise weigh down and even topple ALPHA on its side.

            <h2>Chassis</h2>
            <p>
                The chassis is the very foundation of ALPHA. Everything is either built on or attached to the chassis&mdash;the wheels, the arm, and even the Seed Dispenser. Thanks to our incredible engineering team here at MAAC, we've compacted all of that into an 18" by 14" area.

            <h2>Arm Tower</h2>
            <p>
                The arm tower has been carefully designed to allow for an increased range of motion while maintaining a low center of gravity. The triangular form provides the structural strength that is needed when harvesting crops.

            <h2>Seed Dispenser</h2>
            <p>
               The Seed Dispenser receives the corn seeds from the funnel. The seeds fall into the box and are aligned using ramps. The use of ramps reduces the impact on the servo-motor that releases the seeds, thus preventing loss of product. The Seed Dispenser streamlines the seed-collecting process and increases efficiency on your farm.

            <h2>Arm</h2>
            <p>
                Our collection arm is more efficient than the competition with its telescoping capacity, capable of collecting six ears of corn. The larger capacity reduces the time spent transporting crops by nearly 83% on average.
