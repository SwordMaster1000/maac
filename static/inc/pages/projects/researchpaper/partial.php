         MACH Automated Agricultural Company decided to use Precision Agriculture, instead of conventional farming methods, to help family farms thrive. Precision Agriculture uses modern technology to help farmers lower their water and fertilizer inputs while increasing the output of crops. Precision Ag is also suited to fields with diverse soil quality. MAAC has chosen to use Precision Agriculture specifically for this year’s BEST Game.
    <br><br>
    Precision Ag helps the produce market by cutting down on the farmers input in a specific field. Hence, the farmer can afford to plant more crops, and the crops can be sold for a reduced price. Precision Ag optimizes the quantity of crops that can be grown in one field. It also accommodates the population move from rural to urban by optimizing a field’s yield. 
<br><br>
    Precision Agriculture uses recent technology (including GPS and drones) to tailor water and fertilizer quantities to a specific field. Tractors use GPS to make sure they don’t fertilize or water an area of the field that has already been gone over. Using GPS also allows a tractor to guide itself about the field using satellites and information . This technology helps reduce human error in tractor operation. GPS controlled tractors can even get within a one inch of accuracy for plowing, planting, or harvesting. Precision Ag uses drone technology to analyze fields and crop health allowing farmers to access information about their crops without having to be physically in the field.

According to <a target="_blank" href="http://singularityhub.com">singularityhub.com</a>, this technology used to be only for governmental purposes and operations for space. Now GPS is being used for the local farmer. Gone are the days of the two-horse plow that could only cultivate one row at a time. Now are the days of technology where the modern tractor is equipped with a touch screen GPS console. “The mechanization of farming is considered one of the top ten accomplishments of the 20th century.”(<a target="_blank" href="http://singularityhub.com">singularityhub.com</a>)

 According to a 2011 Auburn University news release, John Fulton said that the 60 percent of Alabama farmers who started using Precision Agriculture technologies on their farms saved $10 million on crop inputs. They saved because they were not laying extra pesticides and fertilizer over areas of the field that didn't need it. Instead, valuable pesticides and fertilizer were saved for the sections that needed extra.

 Business Alabama’s “Big Data on the Farm” publication from June 2014 details that row farmers are using technology in agriculture to increase their outputs. The technology includes satellite images, GPS, modems, and computers. “Although Alabama isn’t always known for being on the cutting edge, its farming industry is relatively sophisticated, says Mask. ‘Alabama is way ahead of surrounding states when it comes to using information technology in farming, and it’s paying off.’”

 Hillsboro farmers Don and Brian Glenn used resources from Auburn University and began using technology on their farm in the 1990s. The brothers became pioneers in Precision Agriculture in the state of Alabama. They minimize their inputs while maximizing their outputs of corn, soybeans, canola, and wheat. “We might not have the largest farm in Alabama, but we’re making sure we’re getting the most from every acre we do have,” Don Glenn says. “We want to be good stewards of the land and not using excessive amounts of inputs, such as insecticide and fertilizer.”
